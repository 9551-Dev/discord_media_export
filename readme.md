Downloads all media files you sent in a given discord channel with the message data from discord GDPR privacy data export

~~requires you to run https://github.com/ShufflePerson/Discord_CDN if you want to get all the data from the forsaken discord CDN~~

No longer required, now just eats up a discord token

tested with about 15k images and videos, seems to work ig.

literally the second thing i wrote with rust i have no idea what im doing
